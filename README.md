# Automatic-Colorization-of-Photos-using-Deep-Neural-Networks
In this project we have made a model which can convert gray scale images into colourised image using deep neural network and with the help of GAN(generative adversarial network). We used Cifar-10 Dataset to get the images needed for this project. It uses a CNN to analyze the colors across a set of color images, and their black and white versions.

## About GAN
GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) represents a cutting-edge approach to generative modeling within deep learning, often leveraging architectures like convolutional neural networks. The goal of generative modeling is to autonomously identify patterns in input data, enabling the model to produce new examples that feasibly resemble the original dataset.
